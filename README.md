Modelling Simulation and Optimization for Highway Simulation using Python



The use of autonomous vehicles has increased in past few years. 
Traffic congestion is a severe problem faced my many countries. In this paper, the simulation model is implemented for motorway vehicles. 
The study is divided into three different parts. The model achieves the throughput of 174 Cars/Hour when simulated on multi-lane multiple vehicles with lane changing behavior. 
Topt is 52.43 s. The density of the model is 3.32. Throughput obtained for rigid trucks is 95.84 Cars/Hour and cars is 95.94 Cars/Hour.


The first part contains two simulations for two different kinds of vehicles i.e., Rigid Truck and Car separately. 
These two types of vehicles are prominently observed on a motorway, other vehicles can be studied as well but for this paper, we will be working with these two types of vehicles.
